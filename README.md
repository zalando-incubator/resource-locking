## Purpose

The resource-locking library provides a service that does pessimistic locking of a resource using different backends. You can use this library to synchronize running jobs over different instances or do pessimistic locking for the same resource over different instances.

## Features

* resource-locking with etcd as backend
* resource-locking with JDBC as backend and access via SQL statements
* resource-locking with JDBC as backend and access via SQL stored procedures

## Usage

Use the provided Spring Boot Starter library and either.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.zalando</groupId>
  <artifactId>resource-locking-starter</artifactId>
  <version>RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
```

### etcd

If you want to use etcd backend include the following dependency that provides the etcd client:  

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.zalando</groupId>
  <artifactId>zalando-boot-etcd</artifactId>
  <version>2.3</version>
</dependency>
```

Additionally write a configuration that provides the specific backend for resource locking.

```java
@Configuration()
public class ResourceLockManagerConfiguration {
   
    @Bean
    public ResourceLockManager resourceLockManager(EtcdClient etcdClient) {
        return new ResourceLockManagerEtcdImpl(etcdClient, "resource-locking-sample");
    }
}
```

### jdbc

If you want to use jdbc backend include the following dependency that provides the etcd client:  

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-jdbc</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Additionally write a configuration that provides the specific backend for resource locking.

```java
@Configuration()
public class ResourceLockManagerConfiguration {
    
    @Bean
    public ResourceLockManager resourceLockManager(JdbcTemplate template) {
        return new ResourceLockManagerJdbcImpl(template);
        // OR: return new ResourceLockManagerJdbcFunctionImpl(template);
    }
}
```
